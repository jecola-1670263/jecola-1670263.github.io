		<h1>Ping is a fun activity enjoyed worldwide, however it has many problems.</h1>
		<p id="Parag1">Ok ok so the problem that have is that uhh... Well like you hit the ball right, but also you have to hit it to a specific place
		and that is difficult, but a lot of the time the margin of a really good hit and a really bad hit (i.e. it goes out or hit the edge of the table) is really small.
		So it's like as you get better you still hit it out the same percentage of times because though your hits are more accurate, you aim closer and closer to the edge.
		So as you practice it is difficult for you to grok how much better you are getter at the game which is unfortunate because seeing you work paid off feels really good.</p>
